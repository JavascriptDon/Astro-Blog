<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">In this article, we'll use JSON Server, a <b>Node Module</b> that enables you to quickly develop an example REST API in 30 seconds.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Refer to this website <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">here</a> to learn how to install Node.JS if you haven't already.</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Getting started</h2>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Start our new project by creating it in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/">visual studio code</a> with the file structure inside of your backend folder. </p>

```
Mock API
 |- db.json
 |- server.js
 |- package.json
 |- package-lock.json
 |- node_modules
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> You can now add the following command below to install json-server with output on my machine. </p>

```
// Install the JSON Server
npm install json-server
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> We must set the database as the router, construct the server, utilise the default middlewares for <b>server.js</b> port, and then listen. Running the start script will restore our previous functionality, but we now have much more flexibility. </p>

```
const jsonServer = require('json-server');
const server = jsonServer.create();
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

// Set default middlewares + default router
server.use(middlewares);
server.use(router);

// listen to port
server.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`JSON Server is running on ${port}`)
});

```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Create a database with some data for your `db.json` file. </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Run JSON Server </h2>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Open JSON Server, then launch your localhost database. </p>

```
npx json-server --watch db.json
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Requests can now be sent to `http://localhost:3000/quotes` and will return : </p>

<h2 style="font-size: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Heroku Deployment | 3 Step Deployment </h2>

<ol style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
<li style=" margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> Create an account on <a href="https://heroku.com">heroku</a>.</li>
<li style=" margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Install the Heroku CLI on your <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli">computer</a></li>
<li style=" margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Connect the Heroku CLI to your account by writing the following command in your terminal and follow the instructions on the command line:</li>
</ol>

```
heroku login
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Then start a remote Heroku project, which is similar to starting a GitHub git repository. With a random name, a project will be created on Heroku as a result. You must provide your own name, such as "Heroku create project-name," if you want to name your programme.</p>

```
heroku create my-cool-project
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Push your app to Heroku:</p>

```
git push heroku master
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;">Visit your newly created app by opening it via <a href="https://famous-quotes-project.herokuapp.com/quotes">heroku</a>.</p>

```
heroku open
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> For debugging if something went wrong: </p>

```
heroku logs --tail
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"><a href="https://famous-quotes-project.herokuapp.com/quotes">Check It Out! ðŸ”¥</a></p>
