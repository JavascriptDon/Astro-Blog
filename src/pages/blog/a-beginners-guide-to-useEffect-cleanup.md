<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> With useEffect, you perform side effects from within functional components, which is an important concept for mastering React today. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Here are a couple examples of side effects that will get you thinking in effects: </p>

<ul style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">fetching data</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">directly updating the DOM</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">timers.</li>
</ul>

## What is the useEffect cleanup function?

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">A useEffect cleanup function can prevent memory leaks and remove unwanted behaviour from the function before our component unmounts.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Here are some use-cases for this: </p>

<ul style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">Clean up subscriptions</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">Clean up modals</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">Remove event listeners</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:.5rem;">Clear timeouts</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;"> Now take a look at the code below. Did you notice anything off? </p>

```
import React from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("effect is running!");
      setCount((count) => count + 1);
    }, 1000);
  });

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>You clicked {count} times!</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note - How it keeps counting even though it should only count once!

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Remember that side effects belong to useEffect which is running on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect.</p>

## How can we fix this?

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem"> There are several ways to control when side effects run. You should always include the second parameter which accepts an dependencie array.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">Without it, effects run after every render and setting the state will trigger the effects again. An infinite loop may also happen if you specify a value that always changes in the dependency array.You can tell which one by removing them one by one. However, removing a dependency you use (or blindly specifying []) is usually the wrong fix. Instead, fix the problem at its source.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">So, to fix the issue, we will write our useEffect cleanup function which is pretty easy and straightforward to do. We return a function from our useEffect as seen below: </p>

```
useEffect(() => {
        //effect is running
        return () => {
            //clean up the effect
        }
    }, [input])

```

## When do cleanups run?

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up. Donâ€™t worry if itâ€™s hard to grasp this, weâ€™ll better understand it with the examples below.</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">Letâ€™s fix our counter demo from before and introduce a cleanup function that will run when Counter component unmounts and will stop the timer: </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">In this example the useEffect hook is dependent on a variable that runs once and then runs again whenever the count variable updates.</p>

```
import React from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  const [total, setTotal] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("effect is running!");
      setTotal((count) => count * 2);
    }, 1000);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>You clicked {count} times!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>+</button>
      <p>Total: {total}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

```

> ðŸ’¡ Note - If there are multiple dependencies, they should be included in the useEffect dependency array.

```
//clean up the timer at the end of the useEffect hook
import React from "react";
export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    let timer = setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("effect is running onMount!");
      setCount((count) => count * 2);
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      console.log("component unmounts");
      clearInterval(timer);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>You clicked {count} times!</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>+</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> With useEffect, things are synchronized by default. If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesnâ€™t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. </p>

<p style="font-size: 1.15rem; margin-bottom: 1rem">If you pass an empty array ([]), the props and state inside the effect will always have their initial values. While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount mental model, there are usually better solutions to avoid re-running effects too often. Also, donâ€™t forget that React defers running useEffect until after the browser has painted, so doing extra work is less of a problem.</p>
